# World Bank Data Analysis
This repository presents a comprehensive examination of a World Bank Group dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. Delve into intriguing trends and patterns showcased through engaging visualizations and analyses.


## Overview of the Task
Used Python along, with Matplotlib to analyze and visualize the distribution of age and gender, in the population.
The histogram shows how genders are distributed among the population. By examining the frequency of each gender we can gain insights, into patterns of gender distribution.
In conclusion this data science project utilizes Python and Matplotlib to create visualizations that offer an understanding of age and gender distributions in the world population. Further analysis and exploration can provide insights, into demographic patterns.


## Tools Utilized
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib Library


# Inferences
- Age Distribution Analysis (Bar Chart)
- The bar chart visually represents the distribution of age groups in the world population.
- Analyze the trends and identify any significant age brackets.
- Gender Distribution Analysis (Histogram)
- The histogram illustrates the distribution of genders across the world population.
- Observe the frequency of each gender and draw insights into gender distribution patterns.
